# CZ2001-Algorithm-Codes

This notebook contains Python implementations for all the searching, hashing and sorting algorithm pseudocodes learnt in CZ2001.

I wrote them to better understand the algorithm flow and their related time complexities, as online implementations tended not to follow the given pseudocodes closely. I used them frequently to check against steps and answers during practice by printing the array in every loop and number of key comparisons or swaps. I hope they can be of help to whoever's reading this!

## Implementations

- Sequential Search
- Binary Search
- Closed Address Hashing
- Open Address Hashing with Linear Probing
- Open Address Hashing with Double Hashing
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Dijkstra's Algorithm (I did not implement the specific pseudocode learnt in the module; use it only for checking output!)
